Project HR Analytics Project.
Describe: This case study aims to model the probability of attrition of each employee from the HR Analytics Dataset, available on Kaggle. Its conclusions will allow the management to understand which factors urge the employees to leave the company and which changes should be made to avoid their departure.

Project Exploring the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Market.
Describe: Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies: Full dataset, filtering, and reproducibility.
Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2008, hundreds of similar projects based on the blockchain technology have emerged. We call these cryptocurrencies (also coins or cryptos in the Internet slang). Some are extremely valuable nowadays, and others may have the potential to become extremely valuable in the future1. In fact, on the 6th of December of 2017, Bitcoin has a market capitalization above $200 billion.

This project inolves basic to detailed data analysis of 911 Calls Data, taken from Kaggle. The project is completly done using Python via Jupyter Notebook, using the standard popular Python Libraries for Data Science.
Since, this project is purely based on analysing the dataset, no Machine Learning libraries are used.
Note: The analysis requirements are embedded within the Notebook, as comments!

Project 5-
Project Data Cleaning with Python and Pandas
In this project, I discuss useful techniques to clean a messy dataset with Python and Pandas. I discuss principles of tidy data and signs of an untidy data. I discuss EDA and present ways to deal with outliers and missing and negative numerical values. I discuss how to check for missing values with ASSERT statement. I present how to reshape data using the Pandas melt() function.

Project 6- 
Project Whatsapp Group Chat Analysis and Insight from group chat.
Whatsapp has quickly become the worldâ€™s most popular text and voice messaging application. Specializing in cross-platform messaging with over 1.5 billion monthly active users, this makes it the most popular mobile messenger app worldwide.
I thought of various projects on which I could analyse data like - Air Quality Index or The cliched Covid-19 Data Analysis.
But I thought why not do Data Analysis on a WhatsApp group chat of college students and find out interesting insights about who is most active, who are ghosts (the ones who do not reply), my sleep schedule, the most used emoji, the most actives times of the day, or does the group use phones during college teaching hours?
These would be some interesting insights for sure, more for me than for you, since the people in this chat are people I know personally.
Tasks:
    Data Retrieval & Preprocessing

    Exploratory Data Analysis

    Overall frequency of total messages on the group.
    Top 10 most active days.
    Top 10 active users on the group (with a twist)
    Ghosts present in the group. (shocking results.)
    Top 10 users most sent media.
    Top 10 most used emojis.
    Most active hours and days.
    Heatmaps of weekdays and months.
    Most active hours, weekdays, and months.
    Most used words - WordCloud
